There is a good chance that in is actually input. Whereas near, as a preposition, helps us understand a spatial component; the nearness of this input relative to something else. It's dangling, so it's hard to tell what it's near, but it is likely pixels/samples. in_near and in_far seem like they're being used to do image interpoloation, which supports the idea that near is a refrence to pixels/samples.
