The look and feel are a bundled style system in Java swing, so the 'and' here is really affirming the idea that these concepts are handled in one spot by Java Swing developers	Combined Configuration / UI Concept
and	DECLARATION	Java	https://github.com/immutables/immutables/blob/28ba97e9f3075902e279c1cde3e16be01e365afb/generator/src/org/immutables/generator/Builtins.java	and	CJ	This variable represents the concept of logical the logical 'and' operation. The identifier name, 'and', is a direct nod to the binary boolean function 'and'.	Boolean Concept Name
term_and_class	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/c7019401185cdfa15e1193aad821894c35a83e3f/src/features/feature_selector.cpp	term and class	N CJ N	This variable represents a logical conjunction used to encode joint probability.

treeandInfo	ATTRIBUTE	Java	https://github.com/igniterealtime/Spark/blob/ca028f3a818b94c00f2f600933109087d84fb0b9/core/src/main/java/org/jivesoftware/sparkimpl/plugin/privacy/ui/PrivacyListTree.java	tree and Info	N CJ N	This variable represents  a panel that contains both a tree and an info section. In other words, it combines two display types/areas. The use of 'and' indicates this combination of display types.	Data Pair / Composite Value
server_and_port	DECLARATION	C++	https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/blob/07f9f9d89722a82234e0d111e61b7ff98e88e2db/panda/src/downloader/httpClient.cxx	server and port	N CJ N	This variable is a string that likely contains a string representation of a server url and its port, like example.com:80. Thus, it is used as a compound key of sorts representing the semantic unit of hostname and port.	Data Pair / Composite Value
data_or_diff	PARAMETER	C++	https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/9b891540183ddc834a02b2bd81b31afae71b2153/matlab/+caffe/private/caffe_.cpp	data or diff	N CJ N	This variable is a parameter distinguishing between accessing data (forward values) or diff (backprop gradients). It's used to determine which memory pointer to retrieve. The use of 'or' indicates this variable's use use as a selector between two mutuall exclusive options-- it only contains one value at any given time; one or the other.	Data Pair / Composite Value
null_or_empty	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/854c3b264d6d392ecd1b09c386d919e3c74cb425/nd4j/nd4j-backends/nd4j-api-parent/nd4j-api/src/main/protobuf/tf/google/protobuf/stubs/io_win32.cc	null or empty	NM CJ NM	This variable is a function used to check whether a string is null or the empty string. The use of 'or' affirms that it checks for both states, and if either state is detected, it returns true. It represents compound boolean logic.	Boolean Multi-Condition Test
throw_if_error	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/meta-toolkit/meta/blob/c7019401185cdfa15e1193aad821894c35a83e3f/src/io/xzstream.cpp	throw if error	V CJ N	This variable is a function that represents a conditional action pattern. It throws an exception only if the LZMA return code indicates an error. Thus the 'if' affirms the use of some conditional logic within the function-- throw only happens under certain conditions.	Guarded Action / Conditional Enablement
hash_and_save	FUNCTION	C	https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/blob/9c42d41c14cf83735db37ae662e2bce42c500aaa/src/libgit2/src/libgit2/indexer.c	hash and save	V CJ V	This variable is a function that performs two distinct actions. It hashes the object and saves object metadata. thus, the us of 'and' affirms the two operations that this function uses as subactions within its body.	Data Pair / Composite Value
warn_if_error	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/freeminer/freeminer/blob/86caf1cfbdf3d06f53981adaedc6f1eba7448486/src/client/sound_openal.cpp	warn if error	V CJ N	This variable is a function that performs a conditional side effect; logging a warning message only if an OpenAL error is present. This is a conditional command, similar to throw_if_error, where the conjunction, if, indicates that there is a conditional under which the action will be taken.	Guarded Action / Conditional Enablement
set_server_and_port	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/blob/07f9f9d89722a82234e0d111e61b7ff98e88e2db/panda/src/downloader/urlSpec.cxx	set server and port	V N CJ N	This variable is a function that performs a composite assignment; setting both the server and port simultaneously. The use of the 'and' operator affirms the dual-mutation of these fields as a kind of pair-field mutator, similar to set_height_and_width or set_x_and_y	Combined Action / Sequential Behavior
propagate_when_not_up	FUNCTION	C	https://github.com/naemon/naemon-core/blob/7558c98937ffb15c040daf158f92827b1f338ba6/src/naemon/checks_host.c	propagate when not up	V CJ VM P	This variable is a function that only propagates under the condition that the host is not up. The conditional logic is core to how the function behaves, and 'when' helps specify what the condition is.	Guarded Action / Conditional Enablement
generate_key_or_iv	FUNCTION	C	https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/blob/13f21ebd59317f59b91ce7a48a234ef48989ccf0/epan/dissectors/asn1/pkcs12/packet-pkcs12-template.c	generate key or iv	V N CJ N	This variable is a function that generates either a key or an initialization vector (IV). Thus, the use of 'or' highlights the mutually exclusive nature of the value it returns	Shared Interface for Alternatives

It's a verb conditional compound name where the 'if' indicates a condition under which the verb is applied. The use  of 'if' affirms the boolean predicate logic embedded within the verb prhase	Guarded Action / Conditional Enablement
ifPresent	PARAMETER	Java	https://github.com/immutables/immutables/blob/28ba97e9f3075902e279c1cde3e16be01e365afb/value-processor/src/org/immutables/value/processor/meta/AnnotationInjections.java	if Present	CJ NM	This variable is a function that acts as a boolean flag field. It essentially means 'only apply the annotation if it is already present on the target'. Thus the use of 'if' indicates a predicate-lke boolean or a guard condition.	Guarded Action / Conditional Enablement
ifUnique	PARAMETER	C++	https://github.com/vgvassilev/cling/blob/5e3310ac045d5763cd9852359d1003f3850c2a0c/lib/Interpreter/Interpreter.cpp	if Unique	CJ NM	This variable is a boolean control flag that helps avoid recompioling a function that has already been compiled and exists globally. It esentially determines whether a function shuold be compiled only if it hasn't already been compiled. Thus, the use of 'if' affirms its roll as a guard condition/boolean predicate	Guarded Action / Conditional Enablement
