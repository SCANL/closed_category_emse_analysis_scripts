NextValue is meant to represent the concept of increment moving across values based on its algorithm, but the value of this vareiable is never incremented due to how it's declared and used unless inc somehow modifies it as a side effect.	Temporal / Upcoming Element	Agree
no_callback	DECLARATION	C	https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/blob/9c42d41c14cf83735db37ae662e2bce42c500aaa/src/libgit2/src/libgit2/transports/ssh.c	no callback	DT N	no_callback is a boolean that is checked in order to determine if there is a callback set.	Negation / Exclusion Flag	Agree

While semantically redundant (since no contrastive key is present), it reflects a programming idiom where ‘this’ acts as a synonym for ‘current’—blurring the line between determiner and adjective.	Immediate Context Reference	Agree
thisIteration	PARAMETER	C++	https://github.com/facebook/proxygen/blob/5370e58851d6b363f1edbc542a0daa369ebbf303/proxygen/lib/http/session/HQSession.cpp	this Iteration	DT N	This variable is a boolean that determines whether a loopCallback should run immediately (thisIteration) or in the next loop.

It's hard to tell whether it actually contains all casts, but the surrounding code indicates that all is supposed to relate to the completeness of this set.	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree
allUsers	PARAMETER	C++	https://github.com/fakeNetflix/facebook-repo-ds2/blob/eaf83c59b8fff11cc4c218da7b78a983754727ec/Sources/Host/FreeBSD/Platform.cpp	all Users	DT NPL	This variable is a boolean that is passed, typically, to an EnumerateProcesses function that, based on the name, scans all valid processes. The variable is likely a boolean that tells this function whether to scan processes for allUsers or not, but it's hard to verify.	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree
noInterfaces	ATTRIBUTE	Java	https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/854c3b264d6d392ecd1b09c386d919e3c74cb425/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-core/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/core/util/UIDProvider.java	no Interfaces	DT NPL	This variable is a boolean that records when the call to getNetworkInterfaces has returned something or not.

allMethods	PARAMETER	Java	https://github.com/cglib/cglib/blob/5c947539c1218dc4ff1a14a7c36b4856b0ee6397/cglib/src/main/java/net/sf/cglib/core/DuplicatesPredicate.java	all Methods	DT NPL	This variable is a paraemter that's iterated over and processed. The plural definitely makes sense, and the 'all' determiner likely makes sense, given that one of the calls to this function takes a collection that is populated by an addAll() function	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree
allPools	PARAMETER	Java	https://github.com/apache/drill/blob/f558815feb6560ebbc3d1fcf502acee8fea1e555/exec/java-exec/src/main/java/org/apache/drill/exec/resourcemgr/config/selectionpolicy/AbstractQueueSelectionPolicy.java	all Pools	DT NPL	This variable is a parameter to a function called selectQueue. Looking at calls to selectQueue, it's not clear that 'all' is justified, but it definitely typically represents a filtered list containing a population fitting the filter.

It's filled with errors from this attribute using a loop that is part of the function in which it appears. The use of 'this' and 'that' in these contexts creates a kind of symmetry between the calling object (this) and the	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree

The allProps parameter is populate dby putAll(getters) and putAll(setters), implying that this variable contains, at least, a list of all getter/setter prop methods, or information related to them. Thus, allNames also contains all the names for these methods.	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree

allAnnotatedElements	FUNCTION	Java	https://github.com/immutables/immutables/blob/28ba97e9f3075902e279c1cde3e16be01e365afb/value-processor/src/org/immutables/value/processor/meta/Round.java	all Annotated Elements	DT NM NPL	This variable is a function that aggregates elements from a call to annottions(). It's populated by a call to addAll with annotatedElements as the argument. Thus, it appears to contain a collection all annotated elements as the name suggests	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree
check_last_arg	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/blob/07f9f9d89722a82234e0d111e61b7ff98e88e2db/pandatool/src/progbase/withOutputFile.cxx	check last arg	V DT N	This variable is a function that checks if the last file name in the argument list has the expected file extension and removes it if it does.	Temporal / Most Recent Element	Agree

The use of 'all' signifies that	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree
copy_this_file	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d/blob/07f9f9d89722a82234e0d111e61b7ff98e88e2db/pandatool/src/pandatoolbase/pathReplace.cxx	copy this file	V DT N	This variable represents a function that copies the indicated file into the copy_into_directory, and adjusts the file name to reference the new location	Immediate Context Reference	Agree
get_next_marker	FUNCTION	C++	https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse/blob/5371cd1468c84423729c334ac997f9621b797e9f/src/s3fs_xml.cpp	get next marker	V DT N	This variable represents a function that helps build an xpath expression. In this case, it adds "NextMarker" to the xpath query expression	Temporal / Upcoming Element	Agree
saveEveryMs	ATTRIBUTE	Java	https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/854c3b264d6d392ecd1b09c386d919e3c74cb425/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/optimize/listeners/CheckpointListener.java	save Every Ms	V DT N	This variable represents a threshold. When the interval between time and lastsavedtime is greater than this variable, a checkpoint save is performed.	Population / Subpopulation Reference	Agree
m_what	ATTRIBUTE	C++	https://github.com/toggl-open-source/toggldesktop/blob/013038304ee8e9154db4a45fb642716956cf153b/third_party/plcrashreporter/Dependencies/Catch/catch.hpp	m what	PRE DT	This is a member variable of a class (hence the hungarian m). The class handles exceptions, and this is the what of that exception.	Immediate Context Reference	Agree
ds_last	FUNCTION	C	https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/f5188ff2147517612b410ed607e3843cdf4b51a6/lib/dynamic-string.c	ds last	PRE DT	this variable returns the index of the last character in a string. The DS is a reference to the data structure-- dynamic_string and it is used to prefix most of the functions, thus namespacing them. This is why it's a preamble.	Temporal / Most Recent Element	Agree
